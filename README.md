 The Weather Prediction Datasets comprise two interrelated datasets: weather_prediction_dataset and weather_prediction_bbq_labels. 
 The weather_prediction_dataset contains a comprehensive collection of weather-related data points essential for weather prediction tasks, 
 including temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, and more. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding and predicting weather 
 patterns for short-term forecasts or long-term climate analysis. Complementing this dataset, the weather_prediction_bbq_labels dataset provides 
 binary labels indicating the suitability of weather conditions for outdoor barbecues. Leveraging the weather features from the main dataset, 
 it categorizes each data point as either conducive or non-conducive for barbecuing, enabling users to make informed decisions regarding outdoor activities.
Each dataset includes a main dataset file (weather_prediction_dataset.csv and weather_prediction_bbq_labels.csv, respectively), along with detailed descriptions
of features, data exploration analyses, preprocessing steps, and potential usage scenarios. The weather_prediction_bbq_labels dataset also offers insights into class 
distribution, relationship with weather features, and temporal analysis to aid in decision-making for outdoor event planning.
 Researchers, data scientists, and practitioners can download or clone the repository containing these datasets to explore, analyze,
 and utilize them for various applications. They can be used for weather prediction tasks, predictive modeling, decision support, outdoor 
 event planning, and further analysis as needed.
